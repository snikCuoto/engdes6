I will keep it real, I've spent most of the semester trying to resist the overwhelming urge to throw myself off of the roof of Howe
(you don't have to call CAPS they're already in the loop)

I worked with Vivado in a previous course and figured that I had a decent grasp of the general vernacular of VHDL
however the largest struggle in this lab ended up being setting up the actual software on my device
between my laptop and my desktop, I couldn't get the windows setup instructions to work in a way that would let me open the
software, either through command line or through the files themselves
I ended up resorting to putting it on a linux virtual machine i had lying around from a different course
that ended up doing the trick and let me pull and test some files from last semester on it.
attached is a screenshot of an adder circuit running on the provided VHDL examination tools
